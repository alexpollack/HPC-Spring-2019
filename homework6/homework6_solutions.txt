Q1) MPI-parallel two-dimensional Jacobi smoother

N = 512, lN = 8, p = 64

Time elapsed is 0.593873 seconds.

N = 1024, lN: 64, p = 64

Time elapsed is 0.202850 seconds.

N = 2048, lN = 32, p = 64

Time elapsed is 1.043524 seconds.

N = 4096, lN = 64, p = 64

Time elapsed is 1.883603 seconds.


N = 64, lN = 8, p = 8

Time elapsed is 0.002618 seconds.
